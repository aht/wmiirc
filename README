These are my wmii configurations. Nothing ground-breaking,
however, two things noteworthy:

1. A generic "framework" for status bars, with
one process for each /rbar/* and separate sleep delay.
This much easier to debug than a do-everything 'status' function.

2. Search-by-name+goto-window functionality, which requires dmenu(1),
Python and https://github.com/aht/extproc).
